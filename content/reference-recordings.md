Reference Recordings are described by Dave Pollack as recordings in different styles that you refer to when you are trying to play in a similar style.  For example, when playing a Bossa I might think of a particular song and recording that I know really well to remind me of details of how that style should be played, or how I like it to sound.

You might want have variations for different tempos, etc.
